First off, I love using the keyboard. When I'm forced to use the mouse, my heart cries just a bit. The mouse is an excellent and convenient tool, there is no doubt, but if it's an action I will perform multiple times, I want to automate it with the quick press of a key (or two).

After looking at XMonad a bit, I wasn't quite ready to give up my comfortable XFCE-provided window manager but did want to resize my windows in a way that was convenient. A bit of google-fu led me to <a href="http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/" target="_blank">wmctrl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/soulfx/stiler" target="_blank">stiler.py</a>. Once installed, I setup a new Runner command in Launchy, a simple call to stiler.py with a corresponding argument, and voila, a new tiling manager. It's a bit on the slow side, but it's simple to install and use and fits into my current workflow without much thinking.

As a side note, I think I'm going to use ramdump.com as more of a Tumblog-type site versus a full-on blog. My notebook is full of ideas, but the perfectionist in me doesn't like putting out the smaller posts that my time allows. I'll fight that feeling and use this as my brain dump that I envisioned to begin with.
