		<h1> Chicken Scheme and CouchDB </h1>

		<h1>But Why?</h1>
I've recently been playing around with <a href="http://call-cc.org/" target="_blank">Chicken Scheme</a>, leaving poor Clojure all high and dry (minus some visits to the newly started <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DFW-Clojure/" target="_blank">DFW-Clojure User Group</a>). After building a service in C at work, I've caught the high-performance bug and Clojure hasn't particularly been helpful in that regard. I've also found Chicken Scheme to be very simple with a more straightforward syntax than Clojure. I'll still use Clojure, and am using it on a web-app side-project, but client side I'm really digging Chicken.
<p>I've also been using MongoDB, but (OMG!) there's no driver currently for MongoDB in Chicken Scheme. Until I have the chops to write my own version, I decided I might as well learn a similar DB: enter <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">Couch</a>. In my naive view, it's very similar to Mongo - it's a document-oriented database with JSON (or <a href="http://bsonspec.org/" target="_blank">variation thereof</a>) as its representative data structure. Even cooler, it's already been ported to <a href="http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/couchdb-playbook/" target="_blank">BlackBerry 10</a>. This gives me some really good ideas for new projects.</p>
<h1>The Setup</h1>
I'm currently running <a href="http://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a>, a "fork" of Ubuntu, so this setup guide follows what was necessary for me to get up and going with Chicken Scheme and CouchDB.
<h3>Chicken Scheme</h3>
There are two options. The easy way:
<pre>sudo apt-get install chicken-bin.</pre>
This installs everything for you with no issue, however it's an older version (as seems to be a common issue with the Ubuntu repositories). At the time of writing it's at 4.7.0. You can also install Chicken by compiling from source. Download the tarball from <a href="http://code.call-cc.org/releases/4.8.0/" target="_blank">call-cc.org</a>, untar, and follow the INSTALL instructions. Easy!
<h3>CouchDB Egg</h3>
Chicken Scheme has an extension system which packages and distributes "<a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggs" target="_blank">eggs</a>." An egg consists of Scheme sources plus some meta information such as build scripts and egg dependencies. You can install an egg using the chicken-install utility that comes with Chicken.
<pre><code>chicken-install -sudo couchdb
</code></pre>
<p>This will download the <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/couchdb" target="_blank">couchdb egg</a> along with all eggs in the dependency tree. The utility then begins compiling and installing all eggs along the way. If you don't do a lot of development, chances are likely that you will run into system dependencies that are unmet. Chicken Scheme compiles to C, and as such many eggs have dependencies on C libraries.</p>
<p>The one I hit with couchdb in particular was openssl. These system lib dependencies can be a little tricky to identify. Two tips:</p>
<ul>
    <li>See which egg is failing, then find it in the egg index and look through it's notes which <em>usually</em> indicate dependencies</li>
    <li>Read the error message and decipher from there.</li>
</ul>
For example, my first attempt at installing the couchdb egg failed due to missing openssl header files. The install utility was attempting to compile the openssl egg, which was a dependency of the http-client egg, which is a dependency of the couchdb egg.
<p>A few searches for openssl and I satisfied the dependency with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
</code></pre>
<p>With that successfully in place, another call to install the couchdb egg succeeded.</p>
<h1>Playing Around</h1>
I didn't have time to compile and install a CouchDB server on my machine, so <em>to the cloud</em> I went. I signed up for an account at <a href="https://cloudant.com/" target="_blank">cloudant.com</a> which provides a free-for-small-databases CouchDB compatible database. After signing up, I imported the example database aptly named "crud" and began toying around.
<p>Booting up csi, the Chicken Scheme interpreter, I called <code>(use couchdb)</code> and set out to play. The first hurdle: making a connection. The current documentation says to use something along the lines of <code>(define couch (make-connection &quot;databasename&quot; &quot;http://localhost:123&quot;))</code>.</p>
<p>That failed miserably.</p>
<p>No matter what I tried, the command <code>(get-server-info couch)</code> would fail with a connection refused. <code>(connection-uri couch)</code> showed that the URI struct was still pointing at localhost. Luckily, the <a href="http://code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/release/4/" target="_blank">source for Chicken eggs</a> are available, even for CouchDB. The make-connection function is created by the <code>(defstruct connection ...)</code> expression. I noticed that the server attribute of connection struct is a <code>uri-reference</code>, <em>not</em> a string. Reading through the defstruct docs I figured out the following worked - woot.</p>
<pre><code>(import uri-common)
(define cloudant-url server: (uri-reference &quot;https://username:password@username.cloudant.com&quot;))
(define cloudant (make-connection server: cloudant-url database: &quot;crud&quot;))
(get-server-info cloudant)
</code></pre>
<p>This returns JSON data in Scheme structure:</p>
<pre><code>#((&quot;couchdb&quot; . &quot;Welcome&quot;)
  (&quot;version&quot; . &quot;1.0.2&quot;)
  (&quot;cloudant_build&quot; . &quot;768&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>Since I'm new to Scheme, getting the data out was a bit odd, and I'm sure completely inefficient.</p>
<pre><code>(define server-info (vector-&gt;list (get-server-info cloudant)))
(alist-ref &quot;version&quot; server-info equal?)
</code></pre>
<p>That about sums it up. Hopefully I figure more stuff out and post some updates. Feel free to comment if I'm reading the JSON structure in a completely asinine way. The vector-&gt;list doesn't seem right.</p>
<h1>Update</h1>
The couchdb egg documentation has been updated to cover most of this. I've also noticed a generally handy function that is exported by the couchdb module, json-ref, that makes it simple to grab top-level JSON items like "version" above.
<pre><code>(define server-version (json-ref 'version (get-server-info cloudant)))
</code></pre>
